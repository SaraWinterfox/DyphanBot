# DyphanBot
~~<sup>~~Dyphan's guts~~</sup>~~

An expandable Discord bot! Written in Python3 using
[discord.py](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py). Still in early stages.

Supports plugin-loading from `~/.dyphan/plugins` and `~/.config/dyphan/plugins`
directories, as well as the built-in `plugins` directory.

Currently reads the token from `~/dyphan_token.json`. Filename is *subject to
change* as more configuration options are implemented.
